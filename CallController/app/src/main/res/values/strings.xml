        Leave your old phone at home, divert phone call to your day-to-day phone number when busy.
        \n
        \nWhenever there is an incoming call, it will:
        \n1) reject (so that forward to your day-to-day phone number) if the calling number is in the address book (a.k.a. white list)
        \n2) auto answer the phone call if it is a local spam (not costing a cent)
        \n3) let it be if it is a non-local spam.
        \n4) reject (so that forward) if it is an unknown number.
        \n
        \n Every phone call is archived to your email inbox
